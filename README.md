# Reality 3D

Reality 3D is an advanced AI-powered 3D generation and reality digitization platform that transforms the way we create, preserve, and interact with 3D content. By combining cutting-edge AI technology with decentralized architecture, Reality 3D enables anyone to generate high-fidelity 3D models and contribute to a global digital archive of our world.

## Features

- **AI-Driven 3D Generation**: Transform images, text, or sketches into detailed 3D models
- **Reality Digitization**: Preserve real-world locations and artifacts in 3D digital form
- **Cross-Modal Generation**: Support for multiple input types including photos, text, and voice
- **Collaborative Creation**: Enable global users to contribute and create together

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (for AI model training)
- Node.js 16+

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Reality3D.git
cd Reality3D
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```

### Quick Start

```python
from reality3d import AIModelGenerator, RealityDigitizer

# Initialize the AI model generator
generator = AIModelGenerator()

# Generate 3D model from text
text_prompt = "A futuristic city with floating buildings"
model_3d = generator.generate_from_text(text_prompt)

# Generate 3D model from image
image_path = "city_photo.jpg"
model_3d = generator.generate_from_image(image_path)

# Save the generated model
model_3d.save("output_model.glb")
```

### API Usage Example

```javascript
import { Reality3DClient } from '@reality3d/client';

// Initialize the client
const client = new Reality3DClient({
  apiKey: 'your_api_key',
});

// Generate 3D model
async function generate3DModel() {
  const model = await client.generate({
    input: {
      type: 'text',
      content: 'A medieval castle with high towers'
    },
    format: 'glb',
    quality: 'high'
  });

  // Download the model
  await model.download('castle.glb');
}
```
